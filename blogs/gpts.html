        <h1>A Deep Dive into AI Marvel: Generative Pretrained Transformers (GPTs)</h1>
      </header>
        
      <section>
        <ol>
          <li>
            In recent years, the field of artificial intelligence (AI) has witnessed remarkable advancements, particularly in natural language processing (NLP). 
            Among the most significant breakthroughs are the Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs), a series of language models developed by OpenAI. 
            GPTs have transformed the way we interact with machines, offering unprecedented capabilities in understanding and generating human language. 
            This blog post delves into the evolution, architecture, training, inference, and impact of GPTs, highlighting their transformative potential across various industries.
          </li>
        </ol>
        
        
        <h2> The Genesis of GPTs </h2>
        <ol>
          <li> GPTs are based on the Transformer architecture, introduced by Vaswani et al. in 2017. 
            The Transformer model revolutionized NLP by employing self-attention mechanisms, 
            which enable the model to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence, regardless of their position. 
            This was a departure from the traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, which struggled with long-range dependencies.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2> How GPTs Work </h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
          Pre-training: The model is trained on a vast corpus of text in an unsupervised manner, learning to predict the next word in a sentence. This helps the model capture general language patterns and structures.
          During pre-training, the objective is to minimize the cross-entropy loss between the predicted word probabilities and the actual words in the training data. The loss function can be defined as:
          
          \[ L = -\sum_{i=1} \log P(w_i | w_1, w_2, ..., w_{i-1}) \]

          where \( w_i \) is the actual word at position \( i \), and \( P(w_i | w_1, w_2, ..., w_{i-1}) \) is the predicted probability of the word given the preceding words.
          The optimization is typically performed using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or its variants, such as Adam, which adjust the model parameters to minimize the loss.
          </li>
          <li>
          2. Fine-tuning: The pre-trained model is further trained on specific tasks with labeled data. This step tailors the model to perform particular tasks, such as translation, summarization, or question answering.
          </li>
          <li>
          During inference, the model generates text by predicting the next word in a sequence, given the preceding words. 
          The process is autoregressive, meaning the model generates one word at a time and then uses that word as part of the context for generating the next word. 
          The model samples from the probability distribution \( P(w_i | w_1, w_2, ..., w_{i-1}) \) to generate coherent and contextually relevant text. 
          This can be done using methods like;
          </li>
          <li>
            Greedy Search: Selecting the word with the highest probability at each step.
          </li>
          <li>
            Beam Search: Exploring multiple sequences and selecting the most probable one.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sampling: Randomly selecting words based on their probabilities, which can produce more diverse and creative outputs.
          </li>
          <li>
            Top-k Sampling: Restricting sampling to the top k most probable words.
          </li>
          <li>
            Nucleus Sampling (Top-p): Sampling from the smallest set of words whose cumulative probability exceeds a threshold p.
          </li>
        </ol>
