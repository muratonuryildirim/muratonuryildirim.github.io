                    <p>Hey there! Today, we’re diving into something pretty exciting in the world of artificial intelligence.<br>
                    Imagine if our AI systems could learn new things all the time, just like we do, without forgetting what they learned before.<br> 
                    Sounds amazing, right? Well, let me introduce you our new work FOCIL, a fantastic new method that's making this a reality!
                    </p>
                    
                    <h2>What’s the Big Deal with Online Class-Incremental Learning?</h2>
                    <p>So, let’s start with the basics. 
                    Usually, when AI learns, it needs to keep looking back at old data to make sure it doesn’t forget what it already knows. 
                    This is kind of like cramming for a test by constantly flipping back through your notes. 
                    But this way of learning can be a bit of a pain.</p>
                    
                    <p>This is where "online class-incremental learning" comes in. 
                    It’s a way for AI to keep learning new things as they come along.
                    However, most of the current online CIL models stores some amount of data to avoid forgetting, just like you constantly flipping back through your notes: 
                    it’s slow, uses a lot of memory, and isn’t great for privacy.
                    Now, imagine if the AI could just look at each piece of information once and remember it perfectly without needing to hold on to the old data. 
                    That’s the dream, right? 
                   </p>

                    <figcaption>FOCIL selects connections randomly from a big super-smart network at the beginning of each task, called expert. 
                        Then it trains and freezes the expert at the end of task to prevent forgetting. 
                        However, it allows using the frozen parameters in the subsequent tasks to facilitate knowledge transfer between the experts. 
                        During inference, FOCIL applies a forward pass and selects the most confident expert for the classification.</figcaption>
                    </figure>


                    <h2>FOCIL: Makes The Dreams Come True</h2>
                    <p>FOCIL stands for Finetune-and-Freeze for Online Class-Incremental Learning by Training Randomly Pruned Sparse Experts.<br>
                    Quite a mouthful, but don’t worry, it’s simpler than it sounds! Here’s how it works:</p>
                    
                    <ol>
                      <li><strong>Smart Pruning:</strong> Imagine you have a one big super-smart network.
                        When it’s time to learn something new, FOCIL trims down parts of this network to create a smaller, focused "expert" network just for that task.</li>
                      <li><strong>Expert Training:</strong> This smaller expert network gets trained on the new information.</li>
                      <li><strong>Freeze and Forget Not:</strong> Once the expert is trained, it gets "frozen". 
                        This means it keeps its knowledge intact and won’t get confused while learning something new next time.</li>
                      <li><strong>Adapt and Thrive:</strong> FOCIL also tweaks how much it trims and how fast it learns based on what’s needed, making sure it’s always on point.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <br>
                    
                    <h2>Why Should You Care?</h2>
                    <p>FOCIL is pretty awesome for a few reasons:</p>
                    
                    <ol>
                      <li><strong>No More Forgetting:</strong> Just like a good student who never forgets a lesson, FOCIL ensures the network remembers everything it learns without needing to review old information.</li>
                      <li><strong>Faster and Leaner:</strong> Because it doesn’t need to keep all the old data around, FOCIL is quicker and uses less memory. That’s a win for efficiency!</li>
                      <li><strong>Privacy Matters:</strong> It’s a much better solution for privacy issues. No more worries about where all that old data is going.</li>
                      <li><strong>Proven and Tested:</strong> It has been put through its paces with various tests on popular datasets like CIFAR10, CIFAR100, TinyImageNet, and ImageNet.
                        And guess what? It’s come out on top, outperforming other methods by a long shot. For example, in one test with 100 different tasks, FOCIL performed 4 times better than the best methods out there!</p>
                    </ol>

                        <figcaption>FOCIL selects different hyperparameters for each task adaptively (Figure 1), 
                            outperforms all the existing method at any time step (Figure 2), 
                            and trains more efficiently while returning the highest performance (Figure 3).</figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <h2>Wrapping It Up</h2>
                    <p>FOCIL is a big step forward in making AI more capable of adapting to new information seamlessly.
                    It is setting a new standard for how AI can learn continuously and effectively 
                    by giving an ability to learn new things without forgetting the old, 
                    while all being super-efficient and privacy-friendly.</p>
